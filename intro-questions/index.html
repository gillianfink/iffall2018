	<h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>My name is Gillian Fink and I am a Communication Design major with Sociology and Writing minors. I am a Junior.</li>
		<li>As a major I am required to take this course, but I definitely am hoping to develop my skills to a point where I can potentially see how I enjoy interactions in comparison with print.</li>
		<li>Any experience I have with code has been done in Wolfram Mathematica and R. My math teacher throughout high school used Mathematica as a teaching/learning instrument, and while I struggled with it at times I found it to be very interesting. More recently, I took a course called Statistics for Sociology (a requirement of the minor) in which we had a few lessons and assignments in R.</li>
		<li>I hope to achieve an understanding and some proficiency in UI/UX from taking this course, even if as a supplement to a print-based track.</li>
		<li>One way I expect designing for screen to be different is that the 4 'edges' of the page depend on what device people are using, among other factors, rather than the static 4 edges of a poster, page, etc. when dealing with paper.</li>
		<li>https://www.moma.org/ I think this website demonstrates effective design because it aligns with the aesthetics of the physical museum, is easily readable, and works on multiple screen sizes and orientations.</li>
		<li>https://www.apple.com/ Given that this website's goal is to sell products, I think it is an example of effective communication because it lets images of the products draw your attention, rather than relying on text.</li>
		<li>https://www.itsnicethat.com/ I think this website works well because with categories clearly displayed it is easy to navigate and find what you're looking for without much effort.</li>
