		<li>Taking the text out of the boxes and allowing it to feel less contained would create a more dynamic and striking design.  Something that works nicely, however, is the color thatâ€™s picked up from the images and brought into the boxes.</li> <br>
		<li>I would say the design aesthetic relates to the concept. The typeface chosen fits the tone/subject of the show.</li> <br>
		<li>The imagery supports the text. All of the characters are depicted mid-speech which makes it feel like they are saying these words in this specific moment.</li> <br>
		<li>The aesthetic is consistent; in each of the three versions, the text takes the bottom of the window on the phone versions and the side of the window on the desktop versions. The side the text takes in these versions depends on the image, but it always lies next to the character.</li> <br>
		<li>The text is legible because of the colored boxes they rest in, but finding a way to make it legible without these boxes might benefit your design.</li> <br>
		<li>I think the box color of the Stanley and Kelly versions complement the image more, as they recede back more than the color on the Michael design does. On the Michael design, the text and the image feel like very separate entities, while on the Stanley and Kelly versions these two elements work in harmony a little bit more. In other words, the lavender box comes a little too far into the foreground, while the pink and red boxes are just enough in the foreground.</li><br>
		<li>The box on the Michael desktop version is also hitting at a slightly awkward spot. I feel like it should either cross over his body more, or stay to the left more.</li>
