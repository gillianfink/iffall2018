	<p class=headers>Verse 1</p>
	<p class="verse1">
		If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine <br>
		And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung <br> 
		Would you hear my voice come through the music? <br>
		Would you hold it near as it were your own?</p>
	<br>
	<p class=headers>Verse 2</p>
	<p class="verse2">
		It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken <br>
		Perhaps they're better left unsung <br>
		I don't know, don't really care <br>
	Let there be songs to fill the air</p>
	<br>
	<p class=headers>Chorus</p>
	<p class="chorus">Ripple in still water <br>
		When there is no pebble tossed <br>
		Nor wind to blow</p>
	<br>
	<p class=headers>Verse 3</p>
	<p class="verse3">
		Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty <br>
		If your cup is full, may it be again <br>
		Let it be known there is a fountain <br>
		That was not made by the hands of men</p>
	<br>
	<p class=headers>Verse 4</p>
	<p class="verse4">
		There is a road, no simple highway <br>
		Between the dawn and the dark of night <br>
		And if you go, no one may follow <br>
		That path is for your steps alone</p>
	<br>
	<p class=headers>Chorus</p>
	<p class="chorus">
		Ripple in still water <br>
		When there is no pebble tossed <br>
		Nor wind to blow</p>
	<br>
	<p class=headers>Verse 5</p>
	<p class="verse5">
		You who choose to lead must follow <br>
		But if you fall you fall alone <br>
		If you should stand then who's to guide you? <br>
		If I knew the way I would take you home
